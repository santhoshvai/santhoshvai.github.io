## Professionally

I am a passionate Android developer with a graduate education in embedded software development. I have a good knowledge of the Android SDK and its tooling. I also have quite a bit of experience with the React Native framework.

## Personally

I now live at [Almere, Netherlands](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Almere). My home town is [Dindigul, India](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Dindigul,+Tamil+Nadu,+India). When I am not writing code, I like to cook. I am a [Tesla](http://www.teslamotors.com/) fanboy.
