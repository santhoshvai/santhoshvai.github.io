## Professionally

I found out that I love software development only during the end of my teens. Consequently, even with a bachelors degree in electronics and communication with a good GPA, I was only writing software for tiny mini-controllers during that time. This made to me to graduate with a Master of science degree in Embedded software development. Currently I am, **"Jack of few, master of none"**. I enjoy front end web development, I enjoy writing embedded software and also I love to solve algorithmic problems as a back-end developer. My ambition is to be a **Full stack web developer**. I am a newbie to the software industry. I believe in lifelong learning, so I am never an expert in anything. I am passionate about my work.

## Personally

I now live at [Eindhoven, Netherlands](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Eindhoven/@51.4484856,5.4515104,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x47c6d91b5579c39f:0xf39ad2648164b998). My home town is [Dindigul, India](https://www.google.nl/maps/place/Dindigul,+Tamil+Nadu,+India/@10.3640591,77.9738117,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x3b00aa57a54881e3:0x765a14068982e6e7). When I am not writing code, I like to cook, play and read. I am humble and very disciplined.  I also love watching [SRT playing cricket](http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/player/35320.html) and hearing [music composed by ARR](https://play.spotify.com/artist/1mYsTxnqsietFxj1OgoGbG?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open). I am a [Tesla](http://www.teslamotors.com/) fanboy.
