title: 25$ Smartphone

<p class="lead">I love this Technology</p>

Why do companies make costlier smartphones when you can make a 25$ smartphone with all the features. This is exactly what Mozilla has done. It has all the features that we need, you can check it out [here](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/). I hope this can capture the emerging markets. Let us spend our valuable money on better stuff like food rather on costly smartphones.
