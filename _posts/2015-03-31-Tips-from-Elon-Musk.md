Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla answered few interesting questions on a recent Ask Me Anything on Reddit.

## How does he learn so much so fast?
> I do kinda feel like my head is full! My context switching penalty is high and my process isolation is not what it used to be.

> Frankly, though, I think most people can learn a lot more than they think they can. They sell themselves short without trying.

> One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree -- make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.

This blows my mind. There are three things to learn from this,

+ Fundamentals are crucial
+ We underestimate ourselves
+ Elon is a geek!

## What daily habit he believes has the largest positive impact on his life?
> Showering

Dear Reader, Let us pledge to take a shower at least once every day.

## How to deal with pressure and stress in work?
> There is a great quote by Churchill: "If you're going through hell, keep going."

Enough said.

## How much does he sleep per night?
> I actually measured this with my phone! Almost exactly 6 hours on average.

He is a full blown geek, measures his sleep time daily with his smartphone. But hey, even he needs 6 hours of sleep. I thought he never sleeps!
